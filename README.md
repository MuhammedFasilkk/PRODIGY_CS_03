**Password Complexity Checker** is a Python-based tool that evaluates the strength of passwords based on various complexity criteria.
It helps ensure that passwords meet security standards, making them resistant to common attack vectors like brute force, dictionary attacks, and more.

## Features

- **Complexity Analysis**: Checks password length, presence of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.
- **Scoring System**: Provides a complexity score based on password attributes.
- **Feedback**: Gives feedback on how to improve password strength.
- **User-Friendly**: Simple command-line interface with clear outputs.
